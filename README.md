## Getting Started

This repository contains the code for the backend and frontend of the project. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    `cd backend`
2. Install the required dependencies:
    `yarn install`
3. Start the backend server:
    `yarn dev`
The backend server will start running, and you should see the appropriate log messages indicating that the server is up and running.

### Frontend
    
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    `cd frontend`
2. Install the required dependencies:
    `yarn install`
3. Start the frontend server:
    `yarn start`


I used:

Node version `v16.18.0`

Yarn version `v1.22.19`

The frontend development server will start running, and your default browser will open the application automatically. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

You are now ready to use the application and explore its features.

**Note:** Make sure you have the necessary environment configurations set up for both the backend and frontend, including the required API keys, database connection strings, and any other relevant configuration settings.

Feel free to customize the instructions according to your specific project setup and requirements.
